# README

As web development continues to evolve, it's essential to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and frameworks. One popular combination for building modern web applications is Rails and React.

To help developers learn about these technologies and how they can work together, I created ReactRailsify â€“ a tutorial application that showcases various Rails and React features and technologies.

## What is ReactRailsify?

ReactRailsify is a web application that demonstrates the use of React with a Ruby on Rails backend. It includes features such as Redux Toolkit Query, Active Admin, JWT for authentication, CORS, and other technologies to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to use these technologies.

The application serves as a learning resource for developers who are new to using React with Rails or want to improve their skills. By exploring the code and features, developers can gain a better understanding of how to implement these technologies in their own projects.

## Features of ReactRailsify

ReactRailsify includes several features that demonstrate the power of React and Rails when used together. Here are some of the features you can find in the application:

- Rails 7 application
- React mounted on top of the Rails application
- Redux Toolkit Query for data fetching and caching
- Active Admin for managing administrative tasks
- CORS to allow requests from different domains
- JWT to authenticate users of the application on API requests
- React components for the user interface
- Rails controllers and models for the backend logic
- Rails routes for defining API endpoints
- React Router for defining the Single Page Application (SPA) routes
- and more...

By exploring the code, developers can gain insight into how these technologies work together to create a powerful and flexible web application.

## Using the ReactRailsify Wiki

ReactRailsify also includes a GitHub wiki that provides a detailed guide to building the application and understanding the technologies used. The wiki includes information about setting up the Rails backend, configuring the React frontend, and using Redux Toolkit Query, Active Admin, and other technologies.

By following the steps in the wiki, developers can build the ReactRailsify application from scratch and gain a deep understanding of how each technology is used. This hands-on approach to learning is a valuable resource for developers who want to gain practical experience with React and Rails.

## How to Use ReactRailsify

ReactRailsify is open source and available on GitHub. To use the application, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies, and start the server.


## Getting Started

Before getting started with the application, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Ruby 3.2.0
- Rails 7.0.4
- Node.js 19.6.1
- Yarn 1.22.19

Here are the steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:AlyBadawy/ReactRailsify.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `bundle install` and `yarn install`
3. Create and migrate the database: `rails db:create db:migrate`
4. Start the server: `rails s` or `./bin/dev`

Once the server is running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Contributing
